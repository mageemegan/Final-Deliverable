This notebook saves an .RData object with a data frame that contains biomarkers but organized in a way that is convenient for PCA. 

Load package for reading Excel files:
```{r}
library(readxl)
```

Read files for biomarkers:
```{r}
CF_Biomarkers <- read_excel("CF_Biomarkers.xlsx")
```

Save dataframe as RData:
```{r}
save(CF_Biomarkers, file = "CF_Biomarkers.RData")
```

Now read file with Biomarkers data but organized for PCA:
```{r}
CF_BiomarkersPCA <- read_excel("CF_BiomarkersPCA.xlsx")
```

Save dataframe as RData:
```{r}
save(CF_BiomarkersPCA, file = "CF_BiomarkersPCA.RData")
```
