## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r fig-two-panel-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:two-panel-plot} Two plots in a single figure; left panel is Figure 1 and right panel is Figure 2"}

# Recreate Figure 1
fig1 <- ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Energy and Economic Output") +
  xlab("Energy (bblpd)") +
  ylab("GDP")

# Recreate Figure 2
fig2 <- ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Energy and Economic Output: Expected vs Observed") +
  xlab("Energy (bblpd)") +
  ylab("GDP")
```
